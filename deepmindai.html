                <p class="leading-relaxed">Google DeepMind has created neural network models that learn how to play video games in a fashion similar to that of humans,[8] as well as Neural Turing machines (neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine), resulting in a computer that loosely resembles short-term memory in the human brain.

                    DeepMind made headlines in 2016 after its AlphaGo program beat a human professional Go player Lee Sedol, a world champion, in a five-game match, which was the subject of a documentary film. A more general program, AlphaZero, beat the most powerful programs playing go, chess and shogi (Japanese chess) after a few days of play against itself using reinforcement learning. In 2020, DeepMind made significant advances in the problem of protein folding with AlphaFold. In July 2022, it was announced that over 200 million predicted protein structures, representing virtually all known proteins, would be released on the AlphaFold database.
                    
                    DeepMind posted a blog post on 28 April 2022 on a single visual language model (VLM) named Flamingo that can accurately describe a picture of something with just a few training images. In July 2022, DeepMind announced the development of DeepNash, a model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning system capable of playing the board game Stratego at the level of a human expert. The company merged with Google AI's Google Brain division to become Google DeepMind in April 2023.</p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed">The start-up was founded by Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman in September 2010.Hassabis and Legg first met at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London (UCL).

                    Demis Hassabis has said that the start-up began working on artificial intelligence technology by teaching it how to play old games from the seventies and eighties, which are relatively primitive compared to the ones that are available today. Some of those games included Breakout, Pong and Space Invaders. AI was introduced to one game at a time, without any prior knowledge of its rules. After spending some time on learning the game, AI would eventually become an expert in it. “The cognitive processes which the AI goes through are said to be very like those of a human who had never seen the game would use to understand and attempt to master it.” The goal of the founders is to create a general-purpose AI that can be useful and effective for almost anything.
                    
                    Major venture capital firms Horizons Ventures and Founders Fund invested in the company,as well as entrepreneurs Scott Banister,Peter Thiel, and Elon Musk. Jaan Tallinn was an early investor and an adviser to the company. On January 26, 2014, Google confirmed its acquisition of DeepMind for a price reportedly ranging between $400 million and $650 million.and that it had agreed to take over DeepMind Technologies. The sale to Google took place after Facebook reportedly ended negotiations with DeepMind Technologies in 2013. The company was afterwards renamed Google DeepMind and kept that name for about two years.
                    
                    In 2014, DeepMind received the "Company of the Year" award from Cambridge Computer Laboratory.
