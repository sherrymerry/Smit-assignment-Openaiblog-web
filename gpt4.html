                <p class="leading-relaxed">GPT-4 is more creative and collaborative than ever before. It can generate, edit, and iterate with users on creative and technical writing tasks, such as composing songs, writing screenplays, or learning a user’s writing style.GPT-4 can accept images as inputs and generate captions, classifications, and analyses.GPT-4 is capable of handling over 25,000 words of text, allowing for use cases like long form content creation, extended conversations, and document search and analysis.</p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed">Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its series of GPT foundation models.It was launched on March 14, 2023,and made publicly available via the paid chatbot product ChatGPT Plus, via OpenAI's API, and via the free chatbot Microsoft Copilot.[2] As a transformer-based model, GPT-4 uses a paradigm where pre-training using both public data and "data licensed from third-party providers" is used to predict the next token. After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.</p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed">OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called "Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training."[8] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[9] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[10] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[11] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.</p>
