The lab is hosted at NASA's Ames Research Center</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">The Quantum AI Lab was announced by Google Research in a blog post on May 16, 2013.[1][3][4] At the time of launch, the Lab was using the most advanced commercially available quantum computer, D-Wave Two from D-Wave Systems.[1][3]

                    On October 10, 2013, Google released a short film describing the current state of the Quantum AI Lab.[5][6]
                    
                    On October 18, 2013, Google announced that it had incorporated quantum physics into Minecraft.[7][8][9]
                    
                    In January 2014, Google reported results comparing the performance of the D-Wave Two in the lab with that of classical computers. The results were ambiguous and provoked heated discussion on the Internet.[10][11][12] On 2 September 2014, it was announced that the Quantum AI Lab, in partnership with UC Santa Barbara, would be launching an initiative to create quantum information processors based on superconducting electronics.[13]
                    
                    On the 23rd of October 2019, the Quantum AI Lab announced in a paper that it had achieved quantum supremacy.</p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed">Google’s Quantum AI team has had a productive 2021. Despite ongoing global challenges, we’ve made significant progress in our effort to build a fully error-corrected quantum computer, working towards our next hardware milestone of building an error-corrected quantum bit (qubit) prototype. At the same time, we have continued our commitment to realizing the potential of quantum computers in various applications. That's why we published results in top journals, collaborated with researchers across academia and industry, and expanded our team to bring on new talent and expertise.</p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed">In addition to building quantum hardware, our team is also looking for clear margins of quantum advantage in real world applications. With our collaborators in academia and industry, we are exploring fields where quantum computers can provide significant speedups, with realistic expectations that error-corrected quantum computers will likely require better than quadratic speedups for meaningful improvements.

                    As always, our collaborations with academic and industry partners were invaluable in 2021. One notable collaboration with Caltech showed that, under certain conditions, quantum machines can learn about physical systems from exponentially fewer experiments than what is conventionally required. This novel method was validated experimentally using 40 qubits and 1300 quantum operations, demonstrating a substantial quantum advantage even with the noisy quantum processors we have today. This paves the way to more innovation in quantum machine learning and quantum sensing, with potential near-term use cases.</p>
